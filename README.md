# Wine Quality Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for wine quality prediction using a small dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to understand the basics of neural networks and apply deep learning libraries like Keras to solve real-world problems.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains 12 variables that influence wine quality, including:
- **Fixed Acidity**: Non-volatile acids in wine, expressed in g/dm³.
- **Volatile Acidity**: Indicators of wine spoilage turning into vinegar, in g/dm³.
- **Citric Acid**: A fixed acid contributing to wine's freshness, in g/dm³.
- **Residual Sugar**: Remaining sugar after fermentation, in g/dm³.
- **Chlorides**: Saltiness in wine, in g/dm³.
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Free SO2 in wine, in mg/dm³.
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Total SO2 in wine, in mg/dm³.
- **Alcohol**: Alcohol percentage in wine.
- **pH**: Acidity or alkalinity of wine.
